      " Hello and welcome to a special episode of prosecuting Donald Trump. I'm Ali Velshi. The Department of Justice has unsealed its 49-page federal indictment, charging former President Donald Trump with 37 felony counts in his handling of classified information. This is an historic and important document, and I want to read it to you so that you got every detail about what exactly he and his aide Walt Notta are being charged with. You've heard the highlights about how Trump allegedly lied and schemed to keep documents he knew were classified. But I'll read word for word the transcript of the conversation Trump allegedly had about a sensitive military document. It's between his employees and the descriptions of the documents he allegedly hid in a shower, his bathroom, and a ballroom. Trump of course maintains his innocence, but I'll let you be the judge of that. So here we go. United States of America versus Donald J. Trump and Walt Notta indictment. The grand jury charges that at times material to this indictment, on or about the dates and approximate time stated below, one, defendant Donald J. Trump was the 45th president of the United States of America. He held office from January 20, 2017 until January 20, 2021. As president, Trump had lawful access to the most sensitive classified documents and national defense information gathered and owned by the United States government, including information from the agencies that comprise the United States intelligence community and the United States Department of Defense. Two, over the course of his presidency, Trump gathered newspapers, press clippings, letters, notes, cards, photographs, official documents, and other materials in cardboard boxes that he kept in the White House. Among the materials Trump stored in his boxes were hundreds of classified documents. Three, the classified documents Trump stored in his boxes included information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries, United States nuclear programs, potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack and plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack. The unauthorized disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods. Four, at 12 p.m. on January 20, 2021, Trump ceased to be president. As he departed the White House, Trump caused scores of boxes, many of which contained classified documents to be transported to the Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Florida, where he maintained his residence. Trump was not authorized to possess or retain those classified documents. The Mar-a-Lago Club was an active social club, which between January 2021 and August 2022 hosted events for tens of thousands of members and guests. After Trump's presidency, the Mar-a-Lago Club was not an authorized location for the storage, possession, review, display, or discussion of classified documents. Nevertheless, Trump stored his boxes containing classified documents in various locations at the Mar-a-Lago Club, including in a ballroom, a bathroom and shower, an office space, his bedroom, and a storage room. Six, on two occasions in 2021, Trump showed classified documents to others as follows. A, in July 2021, a Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, the Bedminster Club, during an audio recorded meeting with a writer, a publisher, and two members of his staff, none of whom possessed a security clearance. Trump showed and described a plan of attack that Trump said was prepared for him by the Department of Defense and a senior military official. Trump told the individuals that the plan was, quote, highly confidential, and, quote, and secret. Trump also said, quote, as president, I could have declassified it and now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret, end quote. B, in August or September 2021 at the Bedminster Club, Trump showed a representative of his political action committee who did not possess a security clearance, a classified map related to a military operation, and told the representative that he should not be showing it to the representative and that the representative should not get too close. 7. On March 30, 2022, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the FBI, opened a criminal investigation into the unlawful retention of classified documents at the Mar-a-Lago Club. A federal grand jury investigation began the next month. The grand jury issued a subpoena requiring Trump to turn over all documents with classification markings. Trump endeavored to obstruct the FBI and grand jury investigations and conceal his continued retention of classified documents by, among other things. A, suggesting that his attorney falsely represent to the FBI and grand jury that Trump did not have documents called for by the grand jury subpoena. B, directing defendant Walton Notta to move boxes of documents to conceal them from Trump's attorney, the FBI and the grand jury. C, suggesting that his attorney hide or destroy documents called for by the grand jury subpoena. D, providing to the FBI and grand jury just some of the documents called for by the grand jury subpoena while claiming that he was cooperating fully and E, causing a certification to be submitted to the FBI and grand jury falsely representing that all documents called for by the grand jury subpoena had been produced while knowing that, in fact, not all such documents had been produced. Eight, as a result of Trump's retention of classified documents after his presidency and refusal to return them, hundreds of classified documents were not recovered by the United States government until 2022 as follows. A, on January 17, nearly one year after Trump left office and after months of demands by the National Archives and Records Administration for Trump to provide all missing presidential records, Trump provided only 15 boxes which contained 197 documents with classification markings. B, on June 3, in response to a grand jury subpoena demanding the production of all documents with classified markings, Trump's attorney provided to the FBI 38 more documents with classification markings. C, on August 8, pursuant to a court authorized search warrant, the FBI recovered from Trump's office and a storage room at the Mar-a-Lago Club 102 more documents with classification markings. Trump's co-conspirator. Nine, defendant Nata was a member of the United States Navy stationed as a valet in the White House during Trump's presidency. Beginning in August 2021, Nata became an executive assistant in the office of Donald J. Trump and served as Trump's personal aide or body man. Nata reported a Trump worked closely with Trump and traveled with Trump. The Mar-a-Lago Club. Ten. The Mar-a-Lago Club was located on South Ocean Boulevard in Palm Beach, Florida, and included Trump's residence, more than 25 guest rooms, two ballrooms, a spa, a gift store, exercise facilities, office space, and an outdoor pool and patio. As of January 2021, the Mar-a-Lago Club had hundreds of members and was staffed by more than 150 full-time, part-time, and temporary employees. 11. Between January 2021 and August 2022, the Mar-a-Lago Club hosted more than 150 social events, including weddings, movie premieres, and fundraisers that together drew tens of thousands of guests. 12. The United States Secret Service provided protection services to Trump and his family after he left office, including at the Mar-a-Lago Club, but it was not responsible for the protection of Trump's boxes or their contents. Trump did not inform the Secret Service that he was storing boxes containing classified documents at the Mar-a-Lago Club. Classified Information. 13. National Security Information was information owned by, produced by, produced for, and under the control of the United States government. So into Executive Order 12958, signed on April 17, 1995, as amended by Executive Order 13292 on March 25, 2003, and Executive Order 13526 on December 29, 2009, National Security Information was classified as top secret, secret, or confidential, as follows. A. Information was classified as top secret if the unauthorized disclosure of that information reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the National Security that the original classification authority was able to identify or describe. B. Information was classified as secret if the unauthorized disclosure of that information reasonably could be expected to cause serious damage to the National Security that the original classification authority was able to identify or describe. C. Information was classified as confidential if the unauthorized disclosure of that information reasonably could be expected to cause damage to the National Security that the original classification authority was able to identify or describe. 14. The classification marking no foreign stood for not-releasable to foreign nationals, and denoted that dissemination of that information was limited to United States persons. 15. Classified information related to intelligence sources, methods, and analytical processes was designated as sensitive compartmental information, SCI. SCI was to be processed, stored, used, or discussed in an accredited sensitive compartmental information facility, or a skiff, and only individuals with the appropriate security clearance and additional SCI permissions were authorized to have access to such national security information. 16. When the vulnerability of or the threat to specific classified information was exceptional, and the normal criteria for determining eligibility for access to classified information were insufficient to protect the information from unauthorized disclosure, the United States could establish special access programs, SAPS, to further protect the classified information. The number of these programs was to be kept to an absolute minimum and limited to programs in which the number of persons who ordinarily would have access would be reasonably small and commensurate with the objective of providing enhanced protection for the information involved. Only individuals with the appropriate security clearance and additional SAPS permissions were authorized to have access to such national security information, which was subject to enhanced handling and storage requirements. 17. Pursuant to executive order 13526, information classified at any level could be lawfully accessed only by persons determined by an appropriate United States government official to be eligible for access to classified information and who had signed an approved non-disclosure agreement who received a security clearance and who had a need to know the classified information. After his presidency, Trump was not authorized to possess or retain classified documents. 18. Executive order 13526 provided that a former president could obtain a waiver of the need to know requirement if the agency had or senior agency official of the agency that originated the classified information. One, determined in writing that the access was consistent with the interests of national security. And two, took appropriate steps to protect classified information from unauthorized disclosure or compromise and ensured that the information was safeguarded in a manner with the order. Trump did not obtain any such waiver after his presidency. The executive branch departments and agencies whose classified documents Trump retained after his presidency. 19. As part of his official duties as president, Trump received intelligence briefings from high-level United States government officials, including briefings from the director of central intelligence, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, senior White House officials, and a designated briefer. He regularly received a collection of classified intelligence from the United States intelligence community known as the president's daily brief. 20. The United States intelligence community or U6 mission was to collect, analyze, and deliver foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information to America's leaders, including the president, policymakers, law enforcement, and the military, so they could make sound decisions to protect the United States. The U.Sic consisted of United States executive branch departments and agencies responsible for the conduct of foreign relations and the protection of national security. 21. After his presidency, Trump retained classified documents originated by or implicating the equities of multiple U6 members and other executive branch departments and agencies, including the following. 21. A. The Central Intelligence Agency, CIA. CIA was responsible for providing intelligence on foreign countries and global issues to the president and other policymakers to help them make national security decisions. 22. B.

This included collecting, processing, and disseminating to United States policymakers and military leaders foreign intelligence derived from communications and information systems, protecting national security systems and enabling computer network operations. 22. The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. The National Geospatial Intelligence Agency was a combat support agency within DOD responsible for the exploitation and analysis of imagery, imagery intelligence, and geospatial information in support of the National Security Objective of the United States and the geospatial intelligence requirements of DOD, the Department of State and other federal agencies. 22.

Within the Department of State, the Bureau of Intelligence and Research was a member of the U-SIC and responsible for providing intelligence to inform diplomacy and support United States diplomats. Trump's public statements on classified information. 22. As a candidate for President of the United States, Trump made the following public statements among others about classified information. A. On August 18, 2016, Trump stated, quote, in my administration, I'm going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law, end quote. B. On September 6, 2016, Trump stated, quote, we also need to fight this battle by collecting intelligence and then protecting, protecting our classified secrets.

As President of the United States on July 26, 2018, Trump issued the following statement about classified information. As the head of the executive branch had commander in chief, I have a unique constitutional responsibility to protect the nation's classified information, including by controlling access to it. More broadly, the issue of a former executive branch officials security clearance raises larger questions about the practice of former officials maintaining access to our nation's most sensitive secrets long after their time in government has ended. Such access is particularly inappropriate when former officials have transitioned into highly partisan positions and seek to use real or perceived access to sensitive information to validate their political attacks. Any access granted to our nation's secrets should be in furtherance of national, not personal interests. Trump's retention of classified documents after his presidency. 24. In January 2021, as he was preparing to leave the White House, Trump and his White House staff including Nauta packed items including some of Trump's boxes. Trump was personally involved in this process. Trump caused his boxes containing hundreds of classified documents to be transported from the White House to the Mar-a-Lago Club. 25. From January through March 15, 2021, some of Trump's boxes were stored in the Mar-a-Lago Club's white and gold ballroom in which events and gatherings took place. Trump's boxes were, for a time, stacked on the ballroom stage as depicted in the photograph below. 26. In March 2021, Nauta and others moved some of Trump's boxes from the White and Gold ballroom to the business center at the Mar-a-Lago Club. 27. On April 5, 2021, an employee of the office of Donald J. Trump, Trump employee one, texted another employee of that office, Trump employee two, to ask whether Trump's boxes could be moved out of the business center to make room for staff to use it as an office. Trump employee two replied, quote, whoa, okay, so POTA specifically asked Walt for those boxes to be in the business center because they're his papers, end quote. Later that day, Trump employee one and Trump employee two exchanged the following text messages. Trump employee two, we can definitely make it work if we move his papers into the lake room. Trump employee one, there's still a little room in the shower where his other stuff is. Is it only his papers he cares about? There's some other stuff in there that are not papers. Could that go into storage or does he want everything in there on the property? Trump employee two, yes, anything that's not the beautiful mind paper boxes can definitely go into storage. Want to take a look at the space and start moving them tomorrow, AM 28 after the text exchanges between Trump employee one and Trump employee two in April 2021. Some of Trump's boxes were moved from the business center to a bathroom and a shower inside the Mar-a-Lago club's lake room as depicted in the photograph below. 29. In May 2021, Trump directed that the storage room on the ground floor of the Mar-a-Lago club, the storage room, be cleaned out so that it could be used to store his boxes. The hallway leading to the storage room could be reached from multiple outside entrances, including one accessible from the Mar-a-Lago club pool patio through a doorway that was often kept open.

Trump's disclosures of classified information in private meetings. 32. In May 2021, Trump caused some of his boxes to be brought to his summer residence at the Bedminster Club. Like the Mar-a-Lago Club, after Trump's presidency, the Bedminster Club was not an authorized location for the storage, possession, review, display, or discussion of classified documents. 33. On July 21, 2021, when he was no longer president, Trump gave an interview in his office at the Bedminster Club to a writer and a publisher in connection with a then-forthcoming book. Two members of Trump's staff also attended the interview, which was recorded with Trump's knowledge and consent. Before the interview, the media had published reports that at the end of Trump's term as president, a senior military official purportedly feared that Trump might order an attack on country A and that the senior military official advised Trump against doing so. 34. Upon greeting the writer, publisher, and his two staff members, Trump stated, quote, look what I found. This was the senior military official's plan of attack. Read it and just show it's interesting. And quote, later in the interview, Trump engaged in the following exchange. Trump, well, with the senior military official, let's see, I'll show you an example. He said that I wanted to attack country A. Isn't it amazing? I have a big pile of papers. This thing just came up. Look, this was him. They presented me this. This is off the record, but they presented me this. This was him. This was the defense department and him. Writer, wow. Trump, we looked at some. This was him. This wasn't done by me. This was him. All sorts of stuff. Pages, long look. Staffer, hmm, Trump. Wait a minute. Let's see here. Staffer, laughter. Yeah. Trump. I just found isn't this amazing? This totally wins my case, you know, Staffer. Mm-hmm. Trump, except it is like highly confidential. Staffer. Yeah, laughter. Trump, secret. This is secret information. Look, look at this. You attack. And by the way, isn't that incredible? Staffer. Yeah. Trump. I was just thinking because we were talking about it. And you know, he said he wanted to attack country A and what? Staffer, you did. Trump. This was done by the military and given to me. I think we can probably write Staffer. I don't know. We'll have to see. Yeah, we'll have to try to Trump. Declassify it. Staffer. Figure out a, yeah. Trump. See, as president, I could have declassified it. Staffer. Yeah, laughter. Trump. Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret. Staffer. Yeah, laughter. Now we have a problem. Trump. Isn't that interesting? At the time of this exchange, the writer, the publisher, and Trump's two staff members did not have security clearances or any need to know any classified information about a plan of attack on country A. 35. In August or September 2021, when he was no longer president, Trump met in his office at the Bedminster Club with a representative of his political action committee. During the meeting, Trump commented that an ongoing military operation in country B was not going well. Trump showed the PAC representative a classified map of country B and told the PAC representative that he should not be showing the map to the PAC representative and to not get too close. The PAC representative did not have a security clearance or any need to know classified information about the military operation. 36 on February 16, 2017, four years before Trump's disclosures of classified information set forth above Trump said at a press conference, the first thing I thought of what I heard about it is how does the press get this information that's classified? How do they do it? You know why? Because it's an illegal process and the press should be ashamed of themselves. But more importantly, the people that gave out the information to the press should be ashamed of themselves, really ashamed. Trump's production of 15 cardboard boxes to the National Archives and Records Administration. 37. Beginning in May 2021, the National Archives and Records Administration, NARA, which was responsible for archiving presidential records, repeatedly demanded that Trump turn over presidential records that he had kept after his presidency. On multiple occasions, beginning in June, NARA warned Trump through his representatives that if he did not comply, it would refer the matter of the missing records to the Department of Justice. 38. Between November 2021 and January 2022, NARA and Trump employee 2 at Trump's direction brought boxes from the storage room to Trump's residence for Trump to review. 39. On November 12, 2021, Trump employee 2 provided Trump a photograph of his boxes in the storage room by taping it to one of the boxes that Trump employee 2 had placed in Trump's residence. Trump employee 2 provided Trump the photograph so that Trump could see how many of his boxes were stored in the storage room. The photograph shown below depicted a wall of the storage room against which dozens of Trump's boxes were stacked. 40. On November 17, 2021, NARA text Trump employee number 2 about the photograph Trump employee 2 had provided a Trump stating, quote, he mentioned about a picture of the boxes. He wants me to see it and quote, Trump employee 2 replied, quote, calling you shortly, end quote. 41. On November 25, 2021, Trump employee 2 texted Nata about Trump's review of the contents of his boxes, asking, quote, as he mentioned boxes to you, I delivered some, but I think he may need more. Could you ask if he'd like more in Pine Hall? Pine Hall was an entry room in Trump's residence, Nata replied in three successive text messages. Nothing about boxes yet. He has one he's working on in Pine Hall, knocked out two boxes yesterday. 42. On November 29, 2021, Trump employee 2 texted Nata, asking, quote, next you are on property, no rush. Could you help me bring four more boxes up? Nata replied, yes, of course. 43. On December 29, 2021, Trump employee 2 texted a Trump representative who was in contact with NARA, quote, box answer will be wrenched out of him today, promise, end quote. The next day, Trump representative 1 replied in two successive text messages, hey, just checking on boxes would love to have a number to them today. Trump employee 2 spoke to Trump and then responded a few hours later in two successive text messages. 12 is his number. 44. On January 13, 2022, Nata texted Trump employee 2 about Trump's tracking of boxes, stating, quote, he's tracking the boxes more to follow today on whether he wants to go through more today or tomorrow, end quote. Trump employee 2 replied, thank you. 45. On January 15, 2022, Nata sent Trump employee 2 four successive text messages. One thing he asked was for new covers for the boxes for Monday morning. Can we get new box covers before giving these to them on Monday? They have too much writing on them. I marked too much. Trump employee 2 replied, yes, I will get that. On January 17, 2022, Trump employee 2 and Nata gathered 15 boxes from Trump's residents, loaded the boxes into Nata's car and took them to a commercial truck for delivery to Nara. 47. When interviewed by the FBI in May 2022 regarding the location and movement of boxes before production to Nara, Nata made false and misleading statements as set fourth in count 38 of this indictment, including a falsely stating that he was not aware of Trump's boxes being brought to Trump's residences for his review before Trump provided 15 boxes to Nara in January 2022. Be falsely stating that he did not know how the boxes that he and Trump employee 2 brought from Trump's residents to the commercial truck for delivery to Nara on January 17, 2022 had gotten to the residents and see when asked whether he knew where Trump's boxes had been stored before they were in Trump's residence and whether they had been in a secure or locked location, Nata falsely responded, quote, I wish I wish I could tell you I don't know I don't I honestly just don't know end quote. 48. When the 15 boxes that Trump had provided reached Nara in January 2022, Nara reviewed the contents and determined that 14 of the boxes contained documents with classification specifically as the FBI later determined the boxes contained 197 documents with classification markings of which 98 were marked secret, 30 were marked top secret and the remainder were marked confidential. Some of those documents also contained SCI and SAP markings. 49. On February 9, 2022, Nara referred the discovery of classified documents in Trump's boxes to the Department of Justice for Investigation. The FBI and Grand jury investigations 50. On March 30, 2022, the FBI opened a criminal investigation 51. On April 26, 2022, a federal Grand jury opened an investigation. The defendant's concealment of boxes 52. On May 11, 2022, the Grand jury issued a subpoena, the May 11, SAP, to the Office of Donald J. Trump requiring the production of all documents with classification markings in the possession, custody, or control of Trump or the Office of Donald J. Trump. Two attorneys representing Trump, Trump attorney one and Trump attorney two, informed Trump of the May 11, SAP, and he authorized Trump attorney one to accept service. 53. On May 22, 2022, Nata entered the storage room at 3.47 pm and left approximately 34 minutes later, carrying one of Trump's boxes. 54. On May 23, 2022, Trump met with Trump attorney one and Trump attorney two at the Mar-a-Lago Club to discuss the response to the May 11, SAP, and Trump attorney one and Trump attorney two told Trump that they needed to search for documents responsive to the subpoena and provide a certification that there had been compliance with the subpoena. Trump, in some in substance, made the following statements, among others, as memorialized by Trump attorney one. A, I don't want anybody looking. I don't want anybody looking through my boxes. I really don't. I don't want you looking through my boxes. B, well, what if we, what happens if we just don't respond at all or don't play ball with them? C, wouldn't it be better if we just told them we don't have anything here? D, well, look, isn't it better if there are no documents? 55. While meeting with Trump attorney one and Trump attorney two on May 23, Trump in some in substance told the following story as memorialized by Trump attorney one attorney. He was great. He did a great job. You know what? He said, he said it that, that it was him, that he was the one who deleted all of her emails, the 30,000 emails, because they basically dealt with her scheduling and her going to the gym and her having beauty appointments. And he was great. And he, so she didn't get any trouble because he said that he was the one who deleted them. Trump related the story more than once that day. 56. On May 23, Trump also confirmed his understanding with Trump attorney one, that Trump attorney one would return to the Mar-a-Lago Club on June 2 to search for any documents with classification markings to produce in response to the May 11 subpoena. Trump attorney one made it clear to Trump that Trump attorney one would conduct the search for responsive documents by looking through Trump's boxes that had been transported from the White House and remained in storage at the Mar-a-Lago Club. Trump indicated that he wanted to be at the Mar-a-Lago Club when Trump attorney one returned to review his boxes on June 2, and that Trump would change his summer travel plans to do so. Trump told Trump attorney two, the Trump attorney two, did not need to be present for the review of boxes. 57. After meeting with Trump attorney one and Trump attorney two on May 23, Trump delayed his departure from the Mar-a-Lago Club to the Bedminster Club for the summer so that he would be present at the Mar-a-Lago Club on June 2 when Trump attorney one returned to review the boxes. 58. Between Trump's May 23 meeting with Trump attorney one and Trump attorney two to discuss the May 11 subpoena and June two when Trump attorney one returned to the Mar-a-Lago Club to review the boxes in the storage room, Nata removed at Trump's direction a total of approximately 64 boxes from the storage room and brought them to Trump's residence as set forth below. A. On May 24, 2022, between 5.30 pm and 5.38 pm, Nata removed three boxes from the storage room. B. On May 30, 2022 at 9.08 am, Trump and Nata spoke by phone for approximately 30 seconds. Between 10.02 am and 11.51 am, Nata removed a total of approximately 50 boxes from the storage room. C. On May 30, 2022 at 12.33 pm, a Trump family member texted Nata. Good afternoon, Walt. Happy Memorial Day. I saw you put boxes to POTUS room, just FYI and I will tell them as well, not sure how many he wants to take on Friday on the plane. We will not have room for them. Plane will be full with luggage. Thank you. Nata replied, good afternoon, ma'am. Smiley face emoji. Thank you so much. I think he wanted to pick from them. I don't imagine him wanting to take the boxes. He told me to put them in the room to talk to you about them. D. On June 1, 2022 beginning at 12.52 pm, Nata removed approximately 11 boxes from the storage room. 59. On June 1, 2022, Trump spoke with Trump attorney one by phone and asked whether Trump attorney one was coming to the Mar-a-Lago Club the next day and for exactly what purpose. Trump attorney one reminded Trump that Trump attorney one was going to review the boxes that had been transported from the White House and remained in storage at the Mar-a-Lago Club so that Trump attorney one could have a custodian of records certify that the May 11 subpoena had been complied with fully. 60. On June 2, 2022, the day that Trump attorney one was scheduled to review Trump's boxes in the storage room, Trump spoke with Nata on the phone at 9.29 am for approximately 24 seconds. 61. Later that day, between 12.33 pm and 12.52 pm, Nata and an employee of the Mar-a-Lago Club moved approximately 30 boxes from Trump's residence to the storage room. 62. In sum, between May 23, 2022 and June 2, 2022, before Trump attorney one's review of Trump's boxes in the storage room, Nata at Trump's direction moved approximately 64 boxes from the storage room to Trump's residence and brought to the storage room only approximately 30 boxes. Neither Trump nor Nata informed Trump attorney one of this information. More prosecuting Donald Trump, the full indictment read by me, Ali Velschi in just a moment.

On the afternoon of June 2, 2022, as Trump had been informed, Trump Attorney One arrived at the Mar-a-Lago Club to review Trump's boxes to look for documents with classification markings in response to the May 11th, subpoena. Trump met with Trump Attorney One before Trump Attorney One conducted the review. Nada escorted Trump Attorney One to the storage room. 64. Between 3.53 pm and 6.23 pm, Trump Attorney One reviewed the contents of Trump's boxes in the storage room. Trump Attorney One located 38 documents with classification markings inside the boxes, which Trump Attorney One removed and placed in a Redwell folder. Trump Attorney One contacted Nada and asked him to bring clear duct tape to the storage room, which Nada did. Trump Attorney One used the clear duct tape to seal the Redwell folder with the documents with classification markings inside. 65. After Trump Attorney One finished sealing the Redwell folder, containing the documents with classification markings that he'd found inside Trump's boxes, Nada took Trump Attorney One to a dining room in the Mar-a-Lago Club to meet with Trump. After Trump Attorney One confirmed that he was finished with his search of the storage room, Trump asked, quote, did you find anything? Is it bad? Good? End quote? 66. Trump and Trump Attorney One then discussed what to do with the Redwell folder containing documents with classification markings and whether Trump Attorney One should bring them to his hotel room and put them in a safe there. During that conversation, Trump made a plucking motion as memorialized by Trump Attorney One. He made a funny motion as though, well, okay, why don't you take them with you to your hotel room and if there's anything really bad in there, like, you know, pluck it out. And that was the motion he made. He didn't say that. 67. That evening, Trump Attorney One contacted the Department of Justice and requested that an FBI agent meet him at the Mar-a-Lago Club the next day, June 3, so that he could turn over the documents responsive to the May 11, subpoena. 68. Also that evening, Trump Attorney One contacted another Trump Attorney, Trump Attorney Three, and asked her if she would come to the Mar-a-Lago Club the next morning to act as a custodian of records and sign a certification regarding the search for documents with classification markings in response to the May 11 subpoena. Trump Attorney Three, who had no role in the review of Trump's boxes in the storage room, agreed. 69. The next day on June 3, 2022 at Trump Attorney One's request, Trump Attorney Three signed a certification as the custodian of records for the Office of Donald J. Trump and took it to the Mar-a-Lago Club to provide it to the Department of Justice and FBI. In the certification, Trump Attorney Three, who performed no search of Trump's boxes, had not reviewed the May 11 subpoena and had not reviewed the contents of the Red World folder stated, among other things, that, quote, based on the information that had been provided to her, a, a diligent search was conducted of the boxes that were moved from the White House to Florida, b, this search was conducted after receipt of the subpoena in order to locate any and all documents that are responsive to the subpoena, and c, any and all responsive documents accompany this certification. End quote. 70. These statements were false because, among other reasons, Trump had directed NOTTA to move boxes before Trump Attorney One's June 2 review so that many boxes were not searched, and many documents responsive to the May 11 subpoena could not be found, and in fact, were not found by Trump Attorney One. 71. Shortly after Trump Attorney Three executed the false certification on June 3, 2022, Trump Attorney One and Trump Attorney Three met at the Mar-a-Lago Club with personnel from the Department of Justice and FBI. Trump Attorney One and Trump Attorney Three turned over the Red World folder containing documents with classification markings, as well as the false certification signed by Trump Attorney Three as custodian of records. Trump, who had delayed his departure from the Mar-a-Lago Club, joined Trump Attorney One and Trump Attorney Three for some of the meeting. Trump claimed to the Department of Justice and FBI that he was, quote, an open book. 72. Earlier that same day, NOTTA and others loaded several of Trump's boxes along with other items on aircraft that flew Trump and his family north for the summer. The court authorized search of the Mar-a-Lago Club. 73. In July 2022, the FBI and Grand Jury obtained and reviewed surveillance video from the Mar-a-Lago Club showing the movements of boxes set forth above. 74. On August 8, 2022, the FBI executed a court authorized search warrant at the Mar-a-Lago Club. The search warrant authorized the FBI to search for and seize, among other things, all documents with classification markings. 75. During the execution of the warrant at the Mar-a-Lago Club, the FBI seized 102 documents with classification markings in Trump's office and the storage room as follows. Location, Trump's office, number of documents, 27. Classification markings, top secret, six, secret, 18, confidential, three. Location, storage room, number of documents, 75.
