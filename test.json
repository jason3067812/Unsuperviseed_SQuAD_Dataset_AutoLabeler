          "context": "Hey, this is Chris A's. Well, it's been a truly historic week as a Manhattan Grand jury voted to in Diteformer President Donald Trump. I'm assuming you know that by the time you hear this. Well, MSMBC legal analysts and veteran prosecutors Andrew Weissman and Mary McCord are back with their insights based on their 50 plus years of collective experience of building some of the most complex criminal cases in US history. This podcast is a special inside look at how prosecutors from Alvin Bragg to Fanny Willis to Jack Smith build their toughest cases. Please join me in listening to prosecuting Donald Trump the first indictment with Andrew Weissman and Mary McCord. And if you like what you hear, please subscribe to their feed for future episodes. This is Andrew Weissman. I'm here with Mary McCord. Good to be back again. The plot continues. So what thing, Mary, that I thought it would be useful to discuss is really trying to make sure that people understand what's about to happen now in terms of the Manhattan case. There will be an arrangement by all accounts next week. Absent the former president is deciding not to self surrender and having to be extradited. Although not to self when I was thinking about if he doesn't agree to self surrender, he's supposed to be in New York next month for of all things a civil case where he is accused of rape. And that is supposed to happen at the end f April. And so he needs to appear for that. So he can be arrested then if he doesn't self surrender. And if he doesn't appear for that, a default can be entered against him in a case where it's the allegations are quite serious. So there's a lot of reasons for him to actually just show up. Yeah, it's a good one. So one of the things that that people should be aware of though is that well, everyone's been waiting for the rule of law to be imposed into see this the day of reckoning where he is actually subject to criminal charges. But there's going to be a long time as you and I both know from having tried a ton of cases in a variety of different jurisdictions that you don't just indict somebody and there's a trial the next day that the defendant is entitled to so many procedures. And I think people don't really understand as prosecutors that that sort of embedded in us that that's sort of what we expect and know, which is that a prosecutor is advocating for the government. But they also have a lot of obligations as to fulfill their obligations as part of the due process clause of the Constitution. So discovery is turned over. All sorts of search warrant material is turned over. And then the defendant's entitled to make all sorts of motions for more discovery, Brady material. That's sort of a sculpted or a impeachment evidence. They can make legal motions that Mary, I know, used to be an appellate lawyer. So, you know, that's thank God because that's not my forte. And I was wondering if you could talk about what if anything you you saw in terms of ideal, you know, we don't know exactly what's going to be charged. But we're certainly hearing about this idea that a motion is going to somehow end all of this and that the defense could do that. And I wonder if you had thoughts on that. Yeah. And, you know, you're right. There's so many things that have to take place between an indictment and an arrangement and the actual going to trial. And even though there are speedy trial rights, you know, in the Constitution and by statute, that process just takes time, particularly in a case like this where there's going to be voluminous amount of discovery turned over and motions practice, etc. We're already hearing though from some of Trump's former lawyers and current lawyers that, oh, motions to dismiss are going to be imminent. And it's interesting because motions to dismiss a criminal case. That's not the most common thing, right? We that always happens in almost every civil case, a civil cases file, the defense says this should be dismissed because you failed to state a claim or all these other reasons. And sometimes cases are dismissed right there at that early stage. In a criminal case, it's very different because there aren't that many grounds where you could get an entire criminal case thrown out on legal grounds by a judge. Because normally criminal cases are based on a factual scenario that's alleged in the indictment that violates laws and that the legal issues get resolved by a court in advance of a trial. But then during a trial, that's when a jury wore a judge.",
